# restaurant-page

Project Outline:

This is a project I undertook as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The primary objective of this project was to create a restaurant page that had multiple 'tabs' to navigate through the site. The tabs would populate the page using Javascipt only from separate files/modules. It was also part of the project to configure and setup Webpack to bundle everything together, so this was my first time using both modules and Webpack for a project.

Challenges:

I really wanted to clean up my code this time around having made projects in the past that went against the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule. Seeing as this project involved a lot of creating elements for the DOM I created a function to create and return DOM elements that had their attributes and textContent set via parameters. This made the project so much easier from that point onwards. Overall I found this project to be pretty straightfoward despite doing a lot of new things like Webpack and JS Modules.

Completed 4/9/24.
